Description: 

I have creatd a web application COVID-19 Tracker using ReactJS and real-time API. In this web application or website, when the user enters the name of the country, it will display the number of active cases, recovered cases, today’s cases, etc.

My component name is CovidData and file name is CovidData.js and for stylings add CSS file CovidData.css.

In the CovidData.js file, I have created the form to take the input and when the form is submitted then we will fetch the data from the API with the help of useEffect Hook and set the fetched the in the variable objects using useState Hook. When the data is fetched then pass the variable objects using JSX expression to display the data. To get datafrom real-time API I have used the “https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/countries” API.

Preview: In http://localhost:3000/, you will see the following output:
